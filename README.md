## Hi there, I'm [Artur Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artur-kim-48a77112) 
I specialize in data engineering and machine learning, with experience solving real-world classification tasks. One notable project involved binary classification for predicting defects in die casting, where I tackled a severe class imbalance (minority class around 1%). I implemented a CI/CD pipeline using Git, CircleCI, Gemfury, Railway, Docker, and FastAPI for model deployment, ensuring continuous integration and seamless REST API access.
Another key project was a multilabel classification task for selecting the optimal mode of transport (Air, Road, Rail, Sea) based on cargo characteristics. This project also involved addressing class imbalance and was supported by a CI/CD pipeline integrating Git, CircleCI, Docker, and Google Cloud, with deployment via FastAPI and REST API.

My ability to implement scalable solutions through MLOps has allowed me to bridge the gap between research and production environments, enabling real-world applications of machine learning models.





## About me
I focus on Machine Learning and MLOps, with experience in both binary and multilabel classification tasks that required handling imbalanced data. I am skilled in Python, SQL, and deploying machine learning models in production using Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud services such as Google Cloud. I enjoy collaborating in teams and solving practical problems, leveraging tools like Git, CircleCI, FastAPI, and REST APIs to deliver scalable solutions.

Check out my projects below to see how I use machine learning and MLOps to tackle industry challenges.
